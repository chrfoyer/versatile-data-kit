### 1. Specify Job Properties

- Click 'Create' to open a dialog box.
- Fill in the job name and job team as appropriate.
- Specify Job Path by inputting the relative Jupyter path to the job directory, using the `parent/child/job` pattern. If no path is specified, the job will be created in the root directory.
- Once all details are filled in, click 'OK' to continue. The job will be created both locally and in the cloud (if available).
